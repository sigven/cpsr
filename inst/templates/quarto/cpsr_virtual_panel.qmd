### Virtual gene panel

Variants reported for the sample are limited to the tile of cancer predisposition genes
shown below. 

::: {.callout-note}
CPSR does not perform any interrogation of _which genes 
that were subject to sequencing_, it merely checks potential overlap of input variants 
within the user-defined __virtual__ panel.

   *  __`r cps_report[['settings']][['conf']][['gene_panel']][['description']]`__
      * Diagnostic-grade genes only (applicable to Genomics England panels): __`r as.logical(cps_report[['settings']][['conf']][['gene_panel']][['diagnostic_grade_only']])`__
   
```{r gene_selection, echo = F, eval = T}
tiles_html <- cpsr::plot_virtual_panels(
  gene_df = cps_report[["settings"]][["conf"]][["gene_panel"]][["panel_genes"]])
```
