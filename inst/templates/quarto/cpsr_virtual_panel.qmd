### Virtual gene panel

Variants reported for the sample are limited to the tile of cancer predisposition genes
shown below. 

   *  __`r cps_report[['settings']][['conf']][['gene_panel']][['description']]`__
      * Diagnostic-grade genes only (applicable to Genomics England panels): __`r as.logical(cps_report[['settings']][['conf']][['gene_panel']][['diagnostic_grade_only']])`__
   
```{r gene_selection, echo = F, eval = T}
tiles_html <- cpsr::plot_virtual_panels(
  gene_df = cps_report[["settings"]][["conf"]][["gene_panel"]][["panel_genes"]])
```

`r tiles_html`

## Note - input data and virtual panel

For the sample in question, `r cps_report$settings$sample_id`, CPSR does **not** perform any interrogation of _which genes that were subject to sequencing_. CPSR classifies only input variants (i.e. as found in the query VCF) within the user-defined __virtual__ gene panel.
