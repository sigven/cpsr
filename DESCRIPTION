Description: CPSR is a computational workflow that interprets germline variants identified from
             next-generation sequencing in the context of cancer predisposition. The workflow is
             integrated with the framework that underlies the Personal Cancer Genome Reporter
             (PCGR - https://github.com/sigven/pcgr). While PCGR is intended for reporting
             and analysis of somatic variants detected in a tumor, CPSR is intended for reporting
             and ranking of germline variants in protein-coding genes that are implicated in cancer
             predisposition and inherited cancer syndromes.
