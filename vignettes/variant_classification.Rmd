title: "Variant classification"

All coding, **non-ClinVar** variants in the set of genes subject to screening have been classified according to a *standard, five-level pathogenicity scheme* (coined **CPSR_CLASSIFICATION**). The scheme has the same five levels as those employed by ClinVar, i.e.

* pathogenic (**P**)
* likely pathogenic (**LP**)
* variant of uncertain significance (**VUS**)
* likely benign (**LB**)
* benign (**B**)

The classification performed by CPSR is rule-based, implementing most of the ACMG criteria related to *variant effect* and *population frequency*, which have been outlined in [SherLoc](https://www.invitae.com/en/variant-classification/) ([Nykamp et al., Genetics in Medicine, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28492532)), and also some in [CharGer](https://github.com/ding-lab/CharGer). Information on cancer predisposition genes (mode of inheritance, loss-of-funcion mechanism etc.) is largely harvested from [Maxwell et al., Am J Hum Genet, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27153395).

The refined ACMG/AMP criteria listed below form the basis for the tier assigned to the **CPSR_CLASSIFICATION** variable. Specifically, the **score** in parenthesis indicates how much each evidence item contributes to either of the two pathogenicity poles (positive values indicate pathogenic support, negative values indicate benign support). Evidence score along each pole ('B' and 'P') are aggregated, and if there is conflicting or little evidence it will be classified as a VUS. This classification scheme has been adopted by the one outlined in [SherLoc](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28492532).

Currently, the **CPSR_CLASSIFICATION** is determined based on the following ranges of pathogenicity scores:
