CPSR is distributed alongside the [Personal Cancer Genome Reporter](https://github.com/sigven). To install CPSR, you should thus follow the outlined [PCGR installation steps (1-3)](https://sigven.github.io/pcgr/articles/installation.html). We recommend Conda as the simplest framework to install PCGR and CPSR, using either a MacOS or a Linux platform.

Assuming you have your PCGR codebase installed in `/Users/you/dir4/pcgr`; type the following to load the environment and check that CPSR is installed (Conda-based):

```text
$ cd /Users/you/dir4/pcgr
(base) $ conda activate ./conda/env/pcgr
# note how the full path to the locally installed conda environment is now displayed

(/Users/you/dir4/pcgr) $ which cpsr
/Users/you/dir4/pcgr/conda/env/pcgr/bin/cpsr

(/Users/you/dir4/pcgr) $ cpsr --version
pcgr 0.7.1

```

You should now be all set up to run CPSR! Continue on to [an example run](running.html#example-run).
