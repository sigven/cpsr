CPSR is distributed alongside the [Personal Cancer Genome Reporter (PCGR)](https://github.com/sigven/pcgr), so please follow
the [PCGR installation steps](https://sigven.github.io/pcgr/articles/installation.html) to install CPSR, either through [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/), [Apptainer/Singularity](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/index.html), or [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).

We recommend [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) as the simplest framework to install PCGR and CPSR, using either a MacOS or a Linux platform.

Assuming you have installed the `pcgr` and `pcgrr` conda envs as described in the above links
at e.g. `/home/user/projects/cpsr_proj1/conda/env/`, you can load the `pcgr` environment and check
that CPSR is installed with the following:

```text
(base) $ cd /home/user/projects/cpsr_proj1
(base) $ conda activate ./conda/env/pcgr
(/home/user/projects/cpsr_proj1/conda/env/pcgr) $ which cpsr
/home/user/projects/cpsr_proj1/conda/env/pcgr/bin/cpsr

(/home/user/projects/cpsr_proj1/conda/env/pcgr/bin/cpsr) $ cpsr -h
[...]
```

You should now be all set up to run CPSR! Continue on to [an example run](running.html#example-run).
