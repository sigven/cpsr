The CPSR software comes with a range of options to configure the report and analysis.

## Key settings

Below, we will outline some key settings that are important for the generation of variant reports with CPSR.

### Virtual gene panel

The user can choose the set of cancer predisposition genes for which input variants should be subject to classification and reporting. The input VCF with germline variants may thus come from any sequencing assay (whole-genome, whole-exome or targeted assay), yet the results shown in the report will always be restricted by the choice of a [virtual gene panel](virtual_panels.html):

* `--panel_id <panel_number>`

#### Custom-made virtual gene panels

CPSR allows users to create custom virtual gene panels for reporting.  Any set of genes found in the [CPSR superpanel (panel 0)](virtual_panels.html#panel-0) can be used to design a custom virtual gene panel. Technically, the users need to create a simple one-column text file with Ensembl gene identifiers, and provide a name for the custom panel:

* `--custom_list <custom_list_tsv>`
* `--custom_list_name <custom_list_name`

The [examples](https://github.com/sigven/cpsr/tree/master/examples) folder contains an example file for a custom-made virtual gene panel.

### ACMG variant classification

The ACMG classification criteria rely heavily upon variant population frequencies from [gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/). The user can specify the preferred population when it comes to variant allele frequencies used by CPSR:

* `--pop_gnomad <pop_code>`

<hr>

There is also an option to set an upper minor allele frequency limit (gnomAD - global population) for variants to be included in the report. This is basically a means to exclude the potentially large number of common and benign variants that can be found in the input VCF:

* `--maf_upper_threshold <maf_threshold>`

<hr>

By default, CPSR provides two types of variant classifications:

1. Existing variant classifications - as provided by ClinVar
2. CPSR-derived classifications of novel variants (not found in ClinVar)

The user may opt to show CPSR's classification of the variants which are already attributed with classifications in ClinVar (i.e. set _1._):

* `--classify_all`

In the final classification, CPSR's classification will not overrule the classification reported by ClinVar, which takes precedence for these variants.

<hr>

Some cancer predisposition genes may be associated with diseases or syndromes that are not directly cancer relevant. The user may choose to ignore/exclude any ClinVar variant associated with _non-cancer phenotypes_ through a dedicated option:

* `--clinvar_ignore_noncancer`

### Optional report contents

CPSR allows users to report recommended [incidental findings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/acmg/), and also the genotypes of reported cancer risk loci from [genome-wide association studies (GWAS)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/):

* `--secondary_findings`
* `--gwas_findings`
* `--gwas_p_value <p_value>` (Required GWAS p-value for variants listed as hits)

## Example run

The *cpsr* software bundle contains an example VCF file.

Report generation with the example VCF, using the [Adult solid tumours cancer susceptibility](https://panelapp.genomicsengland.co.uk/panels/245/) as the virtual gene panel, can be performed through the following command:

```bash
$ (base) conda activate pcgr
$ (pcgr)
cpsr \
	 --input_vcf ~/cpsr-0.7.4/example.vcf.gz \
	 --pcgr_dir ~/pcgr_db \
	 --output_dir ~/cpsr-0.7.4 \
	 --genome_assembly grch37 \
	 --panel_id 1 \
	 --sample_id example \
	 --secondary_findings \
	 --classify_all \
	 --no_docker \
	 --maf_upper_threshold 0.2 \
	 --force_overwrite
```

Note that the example command also refers to the PCGR data bundle directory (*pcgr_db*), which contains the data bundle that are necessary for both *PCGR* and *CPSR*.

This command will produce the following output files in the _output_ folder:

  1. __example.cpsr.grch37.vcf.gz (.tbi)__ - Bgzipped VCF file with relevant annotations appended by CPSR
  2. __example.cpsr.grch37.pass.vcf.gz (.tbi)__ - Bgzipped VCF file with relevant annotations appended by CPSR (PASS variants only)
  3. __example.cpsr_config.rds__ - CPSR configuration object (RDS format), mostly for debugging purposes
  4. __example.cpsr.grch37.pass.tsv.gz__ - Compressed TSV file (generated with [vcf2tsv](https://github.com/sigven/vcf2tsv)) of VCF content with relevant annotations appended by CPSR
  5. __example.cpsr.grch37.html__ - Interactive HTML report with clinically relevant variants in cancer predisposition genes organized into tiers
  6. __example.cpsr.grch37.json.gz__ - Compressed JSON dump of HTML report content
  7. __example.cpsr.grch37.snvs_indels.tiers.tsv__ - TSV file with key annotations of tier-structured SNVs/InDels
